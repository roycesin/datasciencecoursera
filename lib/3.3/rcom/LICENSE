		      (Version 1, March 29, 2013)

         Copyright (C) 2008-2013 Thomas Baier.  All rights reserved.

The "Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  A "work based on the Program" either means the Program or
any derivative work of the Program, such as a translation or a
modification.  Please note that the Program may be available under
different licenses, too.  Please contact the Licensor for for more
information.

The Program is a copyrighted work whose copyright is held by Thomas Baier
(the "Licensor").

BY USING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE PROGRAM), YOU INDICATE
YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL ITS TERMS AND
CONDITIONS FOR USING, COPYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM OR WORKS
BASED ON IT.

THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU (the "Licensee") PERMISSION TO USE THE PROGRAM
OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS.  ALL OTHER ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW.  IF
YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, DO NOT USE OR DISTRIBUTE
THE PROGRAM.


1. Licenses.

Licensor hereby grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
non-sublicensable license to download, install and use the Program on
an unlimited number of computers for Home&Student use.

See section 7 for the definition of "Home&Student" for this license.


2. Restrictions.

This license is subject to the following restrictions:

(a) Distribution of the Program or any work based on the Program to
any party is prohibited.  This restriction also applies to
redistribution of the software inside the Licensee's organization.
However, the following methods of distribution shall not in and of
themselves be a violation of this restriction:

	(i) Manual downloading and executing the setup program once for every
single computer on this computer, where Program shall be installed, from the
official home sites of statconn (http://www.statconn.com and
http://rcom.univie.ac.at/). Download and execution has to be explicitly performed
by a natural person and must not be done automatically to avoid redistribution
restrictions.


(b) All publications based on analyses performed using the Program
directly or indirectly must include the following citation:

      Baier Thomas, & Neuwirth Erich (2007). Excel :: COM :: R.
      Computational Statistics, Volume 22, Number 1/April 2007. Physica Verlag.


(c) This license only covers Home&Student use. All kind of other use
under the STATCONN HOME&STUDENT LICENSE is prohibited. Other
use requires a different license for the Program. See section 8. If
you are unsure if you are entitled for Home&Student use, ask a lawyer.


(d) Activities other than use, copying and distribution of the Program
for Home&Student use are not subject to this License and they are
outside its scope. Functional use (running) of the Program is not
restricted, and any output produced through the use of the Program is
subject to this license only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program).


3. Reservation of Rights.

No rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein.
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties
who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not
have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance and they have received their copies in compliance with this
license (see 2 (a)).


4. Other Restrictions.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical
distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is
permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case,
this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.


5. Limitations.

THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY.  THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.  THE ENTIRE
RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD
THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.


6. General.

This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Austria,
excluding choice of law rules.

If any of the terms of this license agreement or the whole license agreement
at all is void because of applicable laws in your country (or the country of
intended use of the Program), you are not allowed to use or distribute
the Program at all.


7. Definition of Home&Student Use

Home&Student use in the spirit of this license is either

* use at home, for the purpose of studying or personal use only or
* use by a student, for the purpose of studying or personal use only.

As a clarification, the following is provided:

* The Home&Student license does not apply for use in a course (no matter if it
  is a university course, a free public/private course or any other course) and
  must not be used by lecturers or students during this course. The only
  exception is that a Home&Student version may be used for studying after course
  times at home (without an instructor).

* The Home&Student license does not apply for use at work, for consulting
  services or anything else where payment is involved directly or indirectly.
  The Home&Student license also does not apply for work done for anyone else
  (a person or a company), as this is not personal use anymore!

We do provide alternative licenses for other use. See section 8.


8. Alternative Licenses.

In case this license agreement does not permit the use or distribution
of the Program for you, alternative license agreements (commercial or
educational) are available. Please visit

for more information. This also holds true, if any of the terms of the license
agreement may be void due to applicable law and you're not allowed to use
or distribute the Program at all.
