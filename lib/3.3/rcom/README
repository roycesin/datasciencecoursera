rcom DCOM client and server package for R                               08-06-04
================================================================================

Installation
------------

After installing the package, start rgui and load the package using

	library(rcom)

Then register the COM-server (this is a one-time registration)

	comRegisterRegistry()

This will add registry information about the COM server. To uninstall
correctly and remove the information from the registry, call

	comUnregisterRegistry()

After performing registration using comRegisterRegistry() it is recommended
to restart R (and reload rcom).


Problems for COM Client
-----------------------

The console will provide information about problems sometimes. Check
the error messages there for a analysis of the problems.

Error codes shown after invoking a method using comInvoke() normally are
returned by the method itself. Look up the method's documentation first. In
most cases, the problem has nothing to do with rcom.

If the documentation for the COM objects you're using doesn't help you, you
should ask the manufacturer of the object.

Additionally, you should have a look at the mailing list archives (see
below) or post your question to the list.

Contact and Support
-------------------

For support on installation, operation etc. please direct your
questions to the mailing list hosted at
http://mailman.csd.univie.ac.at/mailman/listinfo/rcom-l. You can find
the archives of the mailing list there, too. The list is members-only,
so please subscribe to the list first. Posts by non-members will be
rejected automatically.

The mailing list provides archives of all postings. Please browse the
archives to find an answer to your questions first!

Directing your questions to the mailing list will reach all members of
the list and increases the probability to quickly get the answer you
expect.

Please honor the fact that the authors of this software package are
doing the work in their spare time. Because of this, time for
answering questions is limited. We are doing our best to read all
postings at the mailing list and try to help as soon as possible, but
we will not answer private mail sent to us concerning help for the COM
server. So please post your questions to the mailing list.

If you have any ideas for enhancement of this software please let us
know. It is best to discuss topics on the mailing list and then add
the topic as agreed by all on the list to the feature database at
http://bugzilla.csd.univie.ac.at/. We will do our best to implement
features or future releases.

In case you need direct support, e.g. for a commercial product, or if
your project requires additional features to be implemented in our
software, don't hesitate to contact us. We will be glad to find a
solution for you.


Documentation
-------------

For the rcom DCOM client library, have a look at the documentation
included here, e.g. type

	?comInvoke

to get information about the function comInvoke().

For more information about the DCOM server and additional tools, have
a look at the R (D)COM-Server at
http://cran.r-project.org/contrib/extra/dcom. The information you find
there will also apply to rcom in most cases.

--- the following does not apply to the current version!
The operators [[ and $ are provided to make use of rcom easier. A sample
is shown below:

    > x <- comCreateObject("Excel.Application")
    
    > x[["Visible"]] <- TRUE   # comSetProperty
    
    > x[["Path"]]  # comGetProperty
    [1] "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office\\Office10"
    
    > x$CheckSpelling("hellox")  # comInvoke
    [1] FALSE
    
    > x$CheckSpelling("hello") # comInvoke
    [1] TRUE
    
    > x$Quit()
    NULL
--- end of docs for next release

Thanks
------

Many thanks go to Erich Neuwirth for his valuable comments and support
in testing and finding bugs. Have a look at recent versions of his
Excel-Addin for integration of R into Microsoft Excel.

Gabor Grothendieck (mailto:ggrothendieck@myway.com) contributed code to
ease use of the rcom functions (operators [[, $). Thanks a lot!
